# Spark2018

This repository contains the work done by Ruchi Sharma for her internship during May 2018 - June 2018. Ruchi worked with the Particle Technology Research Group at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. Her project was covered under the SPARK fellowship hosted by IIT Roorkee which invites researchers from all across India to contribute in funded research opportunity for a span of 6 to 8 weeks. 

Ruchi bagged this opportunity right after completing her fresher year of undergrad, and gained significant knowledge of python, recursion, self assembly, fractal geometry, non-linear algebra and force chains in granular materials as a result of this internship.

The mid-review for this internship required presenting a 30 minutes session on the latest research in granular material & self assembly to a group of senior researchers, post-docs, and PhDs. Ruchi loves public speaking and she was very happy with this part of her work :D
