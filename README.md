# FractalTree

Fractals - Images of dynamic system - The picture of chaos. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are driven by recursion i.e. created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

Fractals help us study and understand important scientific concepts, such as the way bacteria grow, patterns in freezing water (snowflakes) and brain waves, for example. Their formulas have made possible many scientific breakthroughs. Wireless cell phone antennas use a fractal pattern to pick up the signals better, and pick up a wider range of signals, rather than a simple antenna.

Anything with a rhythm or pattern has a chance of being very fractal-like.

Images of fractals can be created by fractal generating programs. Because of the butterfly effect a small change in a single variable can
have a unpredictable outcome. Fractal patterns have been modelled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the
practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or natural phenomena with fractal features. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for fractal analysis.

For example: The Sierpinski triangle follows the following algorithm for its formation. Sierpinski triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets:
1. Start with an equilateral triangle.
2. Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle.
3. Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles forever.

Each removed triangle (a trema) is topologically an open set. This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a finite subdivision rule.

Mandelbrot set is used to refer both to a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance of such a set. In general, a Mandelbrot set marks the set of points in the complex plane such that the corresponding Julia set is connected and not computable. "The" Mandelbrot set is the set obtained from a quadratic recurrence equation. 

Fractal geometry is a beautiful branch of mathematics and it has applications in various engineering process. The concepts of Fractals, disorder systems, chaos theory and complexity can be deployed to various chemical engineering concepts such as adsorption isotherms and transport phenomena. Fractals are characterized by Infinite Intricacy, Zoom Symmetry, Complexity from simplicity and Fractional dimensions. Fractals can be found everywhere in the world around you, from a humble fern to the structure of the universe on the largest of scales. Even certain parts of your anatomy are fractal, including your brain.

Fractal mathematics not only allows us to begin modelling the shapes of nature, it can also reawaken our childlike wonder at the world around us.
